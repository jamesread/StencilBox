= Build configs

A Build Config is a YAML file that tells StencilBox how to build a set of pages. Build Configs rely on a template to provide the basic structure of the page, and will often pull in data from data files.

Here is an example of a build config;

.Build Config (`buildconfigs/homepage.yml`)
[source,yaml]
----
name: homepage

outputdir: homepage

template: links-homepage

datafiles:
  links: data/sites.yml
----

You'll see that this simple Build Config is just a few lines of YAML, and it pulls in a data file to populate the page. Here's an example of the data file that goes with it;

.Data file (`buildconfigs/data/sites.yml`)
[source,yaml]
----
title: My Favorite Sites

categories:
  - title: tech sites
    links:
    - url: github.com
      title: GitHub

    - url: slashdot.com
      title: Slashdot

    - url: stackoverflow.com
      title: Stack Overflow

  - title: Funny sites
    links:
      - url: xkcd.com
        title: XKCD

      - url: theonion.com
        title: The Onion
----

The data file is a list of objects, each with a name and url property. When the build is run, it looks up the template defined in the build config (links-homepage), and uses it to build the page. Once it's all put together, it should show up in the SencilBox interface looking something like this;

image::homepage.png[Build Config]

The built page will be saved in the output directory defined in the build config (homepage in this case). You can open the "LINK" to see the built page;

image::homepage-built.png[Built Page]

The template used in this Build Config is xref:builtin-templates/links-homepage.adoc[links-homepage].
