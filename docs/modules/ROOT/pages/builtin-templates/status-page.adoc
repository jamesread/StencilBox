= Service Status page

The service status page template is useful for quickly displaying the status of a number of services. This fits the StencilBox philosophy very well - a YAML data file is used to define the services and their status, and the template generates a simple, clean status page that can be hosted anywhere.

StencilBox does not contain any functionality to automatically check the status of services, or update the data file. That is left up to you.
